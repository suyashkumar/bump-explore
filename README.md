# bump-explore
**bump-explore:**
A Flask server with an angular frontend that allows players to quickly compare their records against each other. Using bump-util tools as data processing engine. Also a project to learn how to build Flask products with Angular. In progress. Repo was shifted over from bump-util after this became a more independant project.
